        <li>Â¼ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon herbes de Provence</li>

        <li>Place prime rib roast on a plate and bring to room temperature, 2 to 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
